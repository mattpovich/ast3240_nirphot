# ast3240_nirphot
Lab Manual for the WHIRC photometry project for CPP AST 3240.

This lab manual is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. Because I expect it to be updated regularly, I am placing it in this GitHub repo that students should access every time they use the manualâ€“that way they are assured to be using the most recent version!
